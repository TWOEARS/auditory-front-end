%% Object-oriented implementation of Two!Ears Auditory Front-End processing
%
% This Demo scripts presents the object-oriented implementation of the Two!Ears
% Auditory Front-End cue/feature extraction. It is intended as a demo at that stage,
% and not a working copy, as important feature are not implemented fully
% yet.
%
% Currently supported features:
% - Mono & Stereo input signals
% - Block-processing (real-time) compatibility
% - Type "getDependencies('available')" in command window for a list of
%   available representations
%
% Not supported yet (though very soon):
% - User-provided parameter handling
% - Multiple requests at startup
% - Feedback handling

%% 1- Basic advantages of object-oriented approach: 
%     Extraction of inner hair-cell envelope for a single audio channel

request = 'innerhaircell';

% Select one channel of the audio signal
data = earSignals(:,2);    

% Initialization is done in two steps:
dObj = dataObject(data,fsHz); % Create a data object based on this signal
mObj = manager(dObj,request); % Instantiate a manager

% Everything is now ready for processing:
mObj.processSignal

% Results are stored in the data object:
dObj.innerhaircell{1}.plot;

% The object dObj contains all the signals computed in the process as 
% objects, each having specific methods, e.g.:
fprintf('\n%s for %s signal was computed for %i frequency channels.\n',...
    dObj.innerhaircell{1}.Label,...
    dObj.innerhaircell{1}.Channel,...
    size(dObj.innerhaircell{1}.cfHz,2))

% Most objects are inheriting from the "handle" super-class, which allows
% to call them "by reference" instead of Matlab typical "by value",
% limiting memory usage from duplicates and allowing for using pointers to
% objects instances instead of duplicates.
% For example, the input and output lists properties of each processor
% (used for routing inputs and outputs) are pointers to the actual
% signals in the data object instead of copies:
if mObj.Processors{2}.Output{1} == dObj.filterbank{1}
    fprintf(['\nmObj.Processors{2}.Output{1} and dObj.filterbank{1} are ' ...
          'two handles to the same signal.\n'])
end

% Having signals implemented as objects allow to attach functions (methods)
% to them. For example the plotting routines already used above, or a 
% method to play the sound as below.
%mObj.Processors{1}.Input{1}.play      % Uncomment for sound

%% 2- Complex scenario:
%     Chunk-based extraction of a frame-based binaural cue (ILD)

request = 'ild';
chunkSize = 2000;   % Chunk duration in samples

% Use both ear signals
data = earSignals;

% Create an empty data object. It will be filled up as new ear signal
% chunks are "acquired". 
dObj = dataObject([],fsHz,10,2);     % Last input (2) indicates a stereo signal
mObj = manager(dObj,request);   % Instantiate a manager

% From here on, simulating real-time chunk acquisition and processing
% request...

% Number of chunks in the signal
n_chunks = ceil(size(data,1)/chunkSize);

% Zero-pad the signal to an integer number of chunks (use for later
% comparison with signal-based processing)
data = [data;zeros(n_chunks*chunkSize-size(data,1),size(data,2))];

% Loop on all the chunks
for ii = 1:n_chunks
    
    % Read signal chunk
    chunk = data((ii-1)*chunkSize+1:ii*chunkSize,:);
    
    % Request processing for that chunk
    mObj.processChunk(chunk,1);
    
end

% Plot the result
dObj.ild{1}.plot;

% Extract the same cue but from the whole signal at once for comparison
dObj2 = dataObject(data,fsHz);  % Create a new data object
mObj2 = manager(dObj2,request); % Create a new manager
mObj2.processSignal;            % Do the processing

% Compute and plot the difference between the two approaches
delta_ild = TimeFrequencySignal.construct(fsHz,dObj.bufferSize_s,'ild',...
    'Difference in ILD, chunk vs. signal-based',dObj.ild{1}.cfHz,'mono',...
    dObj.ild{1}.Data(:)-dObj2.ild{1}.Data(:));
delta_ild.plot;
